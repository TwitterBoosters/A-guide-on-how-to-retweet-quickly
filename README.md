**A guide on how to retweet quickly**

First, go to https://phantombuster.com/

We are greeted by a simple interface. Click on Start free trial

This is where we register the account. We register absolutely on any mail. (You must have access to it in order to confirm it later)

Next, I also put in some random data

Next we are asked to give a session cookie . (You'll need to be logged into your Twitter account to do this).
___
>To get a cookie session install the EditThisCookie extension (I don't need to explain how) Then go to your Twitter profile and open the extension Select _twitter_sess.

Copy the values and paste them into the browser

Click Connect To Twitter (After a few hits, it will insert cookies on its own).

Now we are asked to provide a link to the profile of the person to be retweeted. We need 5 profiles in total

Copy the url of the same X profile and paste it in.

Next, set it to 100 as shown on the screen.

There is a maximum of 5 streams available on the site = we can only retweet 5 profiles at a time

Also, the site has a free period of 2 hours per month. That's enough time for us to get 500 retweets.

Therefore, I don't recommend starting one at a time as every minute counts

We make 5 such ready tabs, after which we press start on each one and wait
